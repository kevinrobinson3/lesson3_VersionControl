            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that is very important to all programmers. It allows you to record changes to files over time, so in the future, you can recollect specific versions. Version control saves many people when they're working on a long and detailed coding project. It prevents people from getting headaches because it allows the user to recover their original files if they mess up. Imagine if you were working on a project for weeks, and all of a sudden you make one mistake, and your project is completely ruined. That is why version control is a life saver. I believe it is very important and interesting to learn about version control because it is something that is essential with working with progamming. It is relevant to this course because we will be using version control just like in this lesson.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Although git may be a little similar to other version control systems, it is much different for many reasons. The biggest difference between Git and other version control systems is the way Git interprets its data. Git will often store the data as snapshots, which is something that no other version control systems do. Also, compared to many other VCSs, the operations of Git are almost all local. Having almost every operation local makes the life easier for the user because the important files of your project will be on a local disk. That is why Git is preferred over many other version control systems. I believe this topic about Git is very important and interesting because it is something that programmers and web developers must learn to work with. It is relevant to the course because we learned about Git in our reading lessons.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Before this assignment, I had no idea how to obtain a Git Repository. But now after learning the process, I realized that it wasn't that difficult. There are two simple ways to getting a Git repository. One way is to take a local directory that is not in the version control, or you can create a clone from an existing Git repository. Both of these ways have been proven numerous times that they're successful. In this project we had to do two git commits. It was difficult at first because it was something that was new to me, but the steps provided by the instructor made it easy to follow along. I believe this topic is important and relevant to the course because we learned about getting a git repository in this lesson.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes to a Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One of the most important aspects about a git repository is to check the status of your files. It is important to decipher whether your files in the working depository are either tracked or untracked. The difference between the two is major. Tracked files can be modified and unmodified, and they are the files that git is aware of. The command that every programmer must remember when checking the status of their files is the "git status" command. If a user is trying to track a new file, they must use the "git add" command. I believe it is very important to remember these commands because it will be the foundation of learning about git repositories. This topic is relevant to the course because we had an assignment based off of git repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git Hub is the website that we had to create an account on for our lesson 3 in this class. Git Hub interests me because it was something that I had never worked with before and I am always wanting to learn and try new things. With the instructions and steps that were created by our professor, it was very easy to learn how to set up a successful Git Hub account. The topic of Git Hub is relevant to our course because it is a service that we will be using for this course, just like we used in this lesson. </p>
